# Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (ZSW) - Research Department ECB

The ZSW is a non-profit research institute in the legal form of a foundation under civil law. It is based in Stuttgart and in Ulm and was founded on the 16th of March, 1988. The foundation's purpose is to transfer already existing knowledge from fundamental research in the fields of renewable energy and rational energy conversion to market-ready, application-based technology to be used by industries located in the state.

## A Leading Energy Research Institute in Europe

ZSW is one of the leading European research institutes for renewable energy sources and energy storage technologies. In the internal organisational structure, the focus is placed on the two business divisions "Photovoltaics" or "Electrochemical Energy Technologies" and "Energy Policy and Energy Carriers". The head of each division is a member of the board. These business divisions are organised into ten departments.

- Systems Analysis (SYS)
- Photovoltaics: Materials Research (MAT)
- Photovoltaics: Modules Systems Applications (MSA)
- Renewable Fuels and Processes (REG)
- Fuel Cell Fundamentals (ECG)
- Fuel Cell Stacks (ECB)
- Fuel Cell Systems (ECS)
- Accumulators Materials Research (ECM)
- Production Research (ECP)
- Accumulators (ECA)


## Research Department Fuel Cell Stacks (ECB)

The research department is specialised in the development of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology with the focus on the construction, characterisation and simulation of fuel cells stacks and components and the construction of prototypes, as well as the development of production and test technologies.

Modelling and simulating processes in fuel cells enables us to rapidly optimise component structures and operating conditions. This also includes the development and establishment of completely new approaches using advanced simulation software that is verified by using conclusive hardware and experiments under realistic conditions. For example, the water management within the gas diffusion electrodes (GDL) and gas distribution structures is validated using Î¼-CT scanning. Using this system, GDL structures, including their water content, can also be investigated in a compressed state. In addition, neutron and synchrotron radiography and tomography techniques developed with the Helmholtz Centre Berlin (HZB) are available for visualising components, cells and stacks, whereby the temporal and spatial resolutions of these are among the best in the world. 

Overview of our topics:
- Components
- Modelling & simulation
- Stack technology
